Tableau Dashboard - Insights
============================

The dashboard is an overview of office supply company, showing sales activity and regional activity via its sales reps. 

From this we can see that one region in particular makes up a comparitively smaller percentage of the overall sales, and is confirmed with it's sales reps reporting 
a lower performance than the company median. 

The other two regions also report low sales in some months, but is more than compensated by higher performing months and strong sales within key categories
(binders, pens, pen sets). 

We can also see that lower performance in the West region may be caused by lower, or higher than average unit prices for pens and binders. A better price offering 
in this region would boost performance.
